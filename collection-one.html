  <div class="mockup-title">ABOUT THE ARTIST / SHANNON CONNOR CASTLE</div>
  <div class="bio-text">
Born in California and currently based out of Santa Fe, New Mexico, Shannon Castle is a self-taught master glass carver. Castle has always embraced bold creativity, fearlessly transforming her visions into groundbreaking glass art. In a field where trade secrets are closely guarded, she has forged her own path, constantly innovating with techniques and materials that push the boundaries of the medium.

Her artistic journey began in childhood, sketching intricate worlds 
inspired by fairytales, revealing an innate talent far beyond her years. 
Drawn to the luminous, dimensional qualities of glass, she envisioned her work coming to life through depth, light, and vibrant color.

At just 19, she founded Shannon Studios in Sausalito, California, 
specializing in architectual glass installations across the West Coast. Over the decades, her work evolved beyond commissions, allowing her artistic vision to flourish without limitations.
